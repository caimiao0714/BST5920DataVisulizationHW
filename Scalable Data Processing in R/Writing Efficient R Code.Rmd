You should only optimize your code when necessary. 

## Keep your R version updated.

One of the relatively easy optimizations available is to use an up-to-date version of R. In general, R is very conservative, so upgrading doesn't break existing code. However, a new version will often provide free speed boosts for key functions. The `version` command returns a list that contains (among other things) the major and minor version of R currently being used.

```{r version}
# Print the R version details using version
version

# Assign the variable major to the major component
(major <- version$major)

# Assign the variable minor to the minor component
(minor <- version$minor)
```
